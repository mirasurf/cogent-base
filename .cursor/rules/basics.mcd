You're working on **cogent-base**â€”a shared and common module to build multi-agent system.

## GENERAL RULES

- Always DO NOT change unrelated parts beyond user requirements.

## DEV CONSIDERATIONS

- After generation, always make sure the code format and linting are performed well. use `make format`, `make autofix`, and finally pass `make quality`.
- Always make sure the existing unittests and integration tests are passed.
- Always perfer modularized design for each module.
- Always declared contants value modules to contain magic values. DO NOT treat error messages as constants.
- DO NOT declare magic values used in multiple positions. Declare constant values instead.
- Always manage python project with `pyproject.toml`
- Always run local commands prefixed by `poetry run`, since we use venv managed by poetry.
