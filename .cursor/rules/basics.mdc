You're working on **CogentBase**â€”Base and shared modules for agentic cognitive computing frameworks (agents) in Python.

Follow the **Google Python Style Guide** for coding standards and best practices.

Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory and follow the TOML format. Global configuration, as well as submodule configurations, are managed via `cogent/base/config.py`. To ensure extensibility and maintainability, each submodule should remain self-contained in both code and configuration.
